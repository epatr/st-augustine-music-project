# [St. Augustine Music Project](https://stamusic.org)

The St. Augustine Music Project is a website that showcases local musicians, artists, and events.

## Credits

stamusic.org was created in the summer of 2017 by [Eric Patrick](https://epatr.com). The site was an exercise in utilizing [Roots](https://roots.io/)' [Bedrock](https://github.com/roots/bedrock) boilerplate for Wordpress and the [Bulma](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma) CSS library.

## Changelog
